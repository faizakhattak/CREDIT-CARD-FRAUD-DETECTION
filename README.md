# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
In this project, we conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, including normalization using the StandardScaler, to prepare the dataset for analysis. We visualized the data to gain insights into its distribution and patterns. Then, we trained and tested a classification model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The results indicated an exceptional accuracy of  0.99997, demonstrating the model's ability to correctly predict nearly all instances in the dataset. Moreover, with a precision of  0.99995, the model accurately identified almost all fraudulent transactions it predicted. A recall score of 1.0 further confirms the model's capability to correctly detect all fraudulent transactions present in the dataset. The high F1 Score,  0.99997, suggests excellent performance in terms of both precision and recall. Despite these impressive metrics, it's important to acknowledge the possibility of false positives and false negatives. Hence, it's crucial to consider the real-world implications of these predictions when deploying the model.
